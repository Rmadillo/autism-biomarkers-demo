# Interactive autism-biomarkers demo

This repository collects the code needed to reproduce the interactive demonstration for the article ["Quest for autism biomarkers faces steep statistical challenges"](https://spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/quest-autism-biomarkers-faces-steep-statistical-challenges/), that we ([Jon Brock](https://drbrocktagon.com/) and myself) wrote for [Spectrum](https://spectrumnews.org/about/). For practical reasons there are a few minor changes from the version in the article, such as use of a more generic font stack.

To run the demo, simply clone the repository and then open the *index.html* file (in the *src* directory) in any modern browser.

The demo uses several open-source JavaScript libraries including [d3](https://d3js.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/). All are included in the *dep* folder. The JavaScript code written specifically for this project is in the *interactive.js* file in the *src* folder.
